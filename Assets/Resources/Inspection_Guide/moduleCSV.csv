,02_01,Make sure that the Lock Nut is loose and you hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator.,If the Lock Nut is not loose; the spindle will not rotate and no measurement is possible.\nYou should hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator; because the heat from your hand will effect the reading if you do not.
,03_01,Identify the 3 Calibration Standards that measure 1''; 2''; and 3'' long. The Calibration Standards can be identified by having an insulated sleeve in the middle. The remaining other 3 items are called Anvils with a collar near one end. The shortest of these Anvils will be used for this inspection.,Different sizes of Anvils are used for each measurement range.  1''-2''; 2''-3''; and 3''-4''\nIf you choose the wrong size Anvil; you will not be able to make the measurement.
,04_01,Wipe clean every surface of the Anvils from any foreign matter before performing each inspection step.,If you do not wipe clean every surface from any foreign matter; small specks of debris will add to the true measurement.
,05_01,Unscrew the knurled Anvil cap from the micrometer and remove whatever Anvil was used last and replace it with the shortest Anvil in the group. Slide the shortest Anvil into the micrometer carefully with the threaded end first and tighten the knurled nut to secure the Anvil in place.,If you do not completely secure the Anvil in place; you will not get an accurate measurement.
,06_01,Calibration can be completed with the longest (3'') calibration Standard. Measure the 3.000'' Calibration Standard. Only turn the Thimble/Ratchet Knob until it starts ''clicking''. Then stop. The reading must be within 2.999-3.001. If it is not then stop and inform instructor.,If you do not properly calibrate the Anvil mic; there is guarantee the measurement will be accurate.

,07_06,Raise the body of the gage so that the beveled contact can be slid over and touch the top surface of the O-Ring Plug. This can be done by raising the body so that it is approxamitely .100 over the surface to be measured; then lock (A) of the clamping screws.  ,This would allow for a rough positioning of the beveled contact above the part.
,08_06,Turn the knurled fine adjustment knob to lower the beveled contact until it just touches the surface. Sliding the sample part back and forth under the beveled extender may be necessary to feel the touch. Note the reading on the display. Then lock (B) of the clamping screws. Make sure the base of the gage is firm on the table and the fine adjustment does not lift the base off the table.,This would allow for a precise positioning of the beveled contact above the part.
