02_Char,01_02,Locate the Electronic Micrometer. ,
,02_02,Make sure that the Lock Nut is loose and you hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator.,If the Lock Nut is not loose; the spindle will not rotate and no measurement is possible.\nYou should hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator; because the heat from your hand will effect the reading if you do not.
,03_02,Note the mode (IN or mm); make sure the Micrometer in in ''IN'' mode by depressing the left button until ''IN'' is displayed on the screen.,If the Micrometer is not in the correct mode (IN);  you will not attain an accurate reading.
,04_02,Zero out the Micrometer by turning the Thimble then Friction Thimble clockwise until the micrometer is closed and you hear the ratchet thimble ''Click''. Press Zero button on micrometer.,If you do not zero out the Micrometer and give the gage a starting point of zero; then any elecrtronic error will compound and skew the reading.
,05_02,With the O-Ring Plug sample on the bench stable; measure the .480-.500 thickness (see sketch). Take the measurement by first opening the Micrometer and then capturing the surfaces to be measured between the inside measuring contacts. Be careful not to let the contact points touch/measure into the radius in the base of these surfaces.,If you let the contact points touch/measure into the radius in the base of this surface; you will not be getting a true reading.
,06_02,Check 3 places approximately 120 degrees apart and calculate average.,You need to turn the part 120 degrees and calculate the average; because the surfaces might not be parallel and 3 measurements gives a more accurate representation.
,07_02,Record final value on paper to the nearest .00X,

03_Char,01_03,Locate the Interchangeable Anvil Micrometer.,
,02_03,Make sure that the Lock Nut is loose and you hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator.,If the Lock Nut is not loose; the spindle will not rotate and no measurement is possible.\nYou should hold the Micrometer by the Thermal Insulator; because the heat from your hand will effect the reading if you do not.
,03_03,Identify the 3 Calibration Standards that measure 1''; 2''; and 3'' long. The Calibration Standards can be identified by having an insulated sleeve in the middle. The remaining other 3 items are called Anvils with a collar near one end. The 3rd longest of these Anvils will be used for this inspection.,Different sizes of Anvils are used for each measurement range.  1''-2''; 2''-3''; and 3''-4''\nIf you choose the wrong size Anvil; you will not be able to make the measurement.
,04_03,Wipe clean every surface of the Anvils from any foreign matter before performing each inspection step.,If you do not wipe clean every surface from any foreign matter; small specks of debris will add to the true measurement.
,05_03,Unscrew the knurled Anvil cap from the micrometer and remove whatever Anvil was used last and replace it with the 3rd longest Anvil in the group. Slide the Anvil into the micrometer carefully with the threaded end first and tighten the knurled nut to secure the Anvil in place.,If you do not completely secure the Anvil in place; you will not get an accurate measurement.
,06_03,Calibration can be completed with the longest (3'') calibration Standard. Measure the 3.000'' Calibration Standard. Only turn the Thimble/Ratchet Knob until it starts ''clicking''. Then stop. The reading must be within 2.999-3.001. If it is not then stop and inform instructor. Otherwise; proceed to the next step.,If you do not properly calibrate the Anvil mic; there is guarantee the measurement will be accurate.
,07_03, If the previous step is compliant within the tollerance defined; check 2.495-2.505 O.D. on the O-Ring Plug sample part or parts. Record value on paper to the nearest .00X.,

06_Char,01_06,Locate the Electronic Height Gage.,
,02_06,Find a clean flat surface on the table to work on. Place a sample part with no burrs flat on the table. Setup the gage with the beveled extender in place as shown.,If the surface is not flat or has burrs on it; you will not produce a proper measurement.
,03_06,Unlock the 2 locking screws by turning them counter-clockwise.,The locking screws are used later in the measurement and must be unlocked to allow the body of the gage to move into location to take the measurement.
,04_06,Move the slide up or down to turn on the electronics of the gage.,
,05_06,Make sure that the gage is in IN (inch) mode. If not; press the ''IN/mm'' button to switch to ''IN'' mode.,If the Height Gage is not in the correct mode (IN); you will not attain an accurate reading.
,06_06,Zero out the gage by sliding the body of the gage down fully until the beveled extender lightly touches the tabe surface and press ''Zero'' on the gage to initialize.,If you do not zero the gage and give the gage a starting point of zero; then any electronic error will compound and skew the reading.
,07_06,Raise the body of the gage so that the beveled contact can be slid over and touch the top surface of the O-Ring Plug. This can be done by raising the body so that it is approxamitely .100 over the surface to be measured; then lock (A) of the clamping screws.  ,This would allow for a rough positioning of the beveled contact above the part.
,08_06,Turn the knurled fine adjustment knob to lower the beveled contact until it just touches the surface. Sliding the sample part back and forth under the beveled extender may be necessary to feel the touch. Note the reading on the display. Then lock (B) of the clamping screws. Make sure the base of the gage is firm on the table and the fine adjustment does not lift the base off the table.,This would allow for a precise positioning of the beveled contact above the part.
,09_06,Check one more position on the same surface to confirm the same value.,You need to check another position ; because the surfaces might not be parallel and 2 measurements gives a more accurate representation.
,10_06,Record value on paper to the nearest .00X,

This will be the true measurement.,The reason for rocking the Caliper back and forth is that you can watch the digital reading and see the smallest reading(truest measurement) which is when the measurement contacts will be aligned properly. If you do not rock the Caliper back and forth; you will not be getting a true reading.
,09_09,Rotate the sample part approximately 180 degrees and make the same measurement.,You need to turn the part 180 degrees and make another measurement; because the surfaces might not be parallel and 2 measurements gives a more accurate representation.
,10_09,Compare both measurements and if they are not the same value continue to make measurements until you are confident you have an accurate measurement.,You need to continue rotating and making measurements; so that you are more confident that you technique is correct.
